# Set is the collection of non-repetitive elements
#Example :
s = {1,3,4} #Set is also created using curly braces like dictionary

s = {} #this will create an empty dictionary 

e = set() # This will create an empty set

""" The main difference between set and dictionary is that set has just elements
    but dictionary has both keys and values assigned together.
