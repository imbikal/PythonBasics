#Loops are set of instructions that are repeated


#Example:

print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)  #This is not efficient way.

#The same task can be done like this in "for loop"

for i in range (1,6):       #This works just like indexing
    print(i)            


    #There are two loops in python : while loops and for loops
