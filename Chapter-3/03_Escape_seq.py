#There is a error when using a next line for text
"""name = "My name is anthony gonsalves

#So the correct way should be to use escape sequence characters:
# \n can be used for new line
name = "My name is anthony gonsalves \n iahioahfa ajnakjnlak"
print(name)



#Similarly to quote something inside a sentence use \"...\"
